# Student-Performance-
this AI project get all the Performance details about the students in the dataset based on different cases 

# The objective of this project is to get the highest accuracy and the best sorting results 
First, Ensure that the dataset is clear from the null values and get the average score from the (math score, reading score, writing score) fields.

Second, identify results in the columns by numbers to make it easy for reading then mapping it.

Third, drop (average score) column from (x) axis.

Fourth, split the data with (train and test split) then using (RandomForst Regressor) to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

Fifth, fit the model and get the predictions and accuracy score.
